# About \it{The Curious Citizen}

## Mission of \it{The Curious Citizen}

~ The mission of \it{The Curious Citizen} is to advance a message of authentic human freedom which flows from knowledge of truth.

## Why \it{The Curious Citizen}?

~ Authentic human freedom only derives from knowledge of truth, which man may know by Divine Revelation and his own natural faculties of reason.

~ God reveals his inner life to man by Divine Revelation, and these truths may be achieved in the human heart by the virtue of faith.

~ In combination with Divine Revelation, man may use his own power of reason to pursue truth with a healthy curiosity.  This yields \it{Curious}.

~ Furthermore, man does not live alone but is social in nature.  To man, laws in keeping with truth are "a mandate of right reason", and "just and due reverence to the laws" stem "from a consciousness of duty" to the truth in the spirit of man (\it{\href{Sapientiae Christianae}{https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_10011890_sapientiae-christianae.html}}, 8-9).  This duty yields \it{Citizen}.

~ Hence, a \it{curious citizen} describes one who seeks truth by faith in supernatural Revelation and exercise of natural reason while seeking righteous obedience to the natural law.

## Why Can There Be "No Freedom apart from the Truth"?

~ Pope St. John Paul II wrote in his moral theology encyclical \href{Veritatis Splendor}{https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_06081993_veritatis-splendor.html} that "there can be no freedom apart from or in opposition to the truth" (96).  The motto of \it{The Curious Citizen} is a slight paraphrasing of this quotation.
